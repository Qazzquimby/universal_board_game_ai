I have another project Board Game Engine which is intended to take in a game implementation and
generate an appropriate zero model for it and train a powerful AI, eventually meant to support very
complex games.

This repository is for smaller prototypes and tests.





- need to be able to turn any game into a graph
- need the graph representation to be enough to play any game well (if the ai sucks theres no point)
- need to somehow be able to get arbitrary choice preferences out of the model (I have thoughts on that but its not solid)
- and the model needs to be able to handle difficult conditions, mostly randomness and hidden info



Add alphazero implementation as reference
Build alphazero and evaluate

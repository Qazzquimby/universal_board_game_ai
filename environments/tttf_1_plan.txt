Making a new game environment called tttf_1

Two players
Each player controls two heroes, which will have a variety of classes
Control alternates Player 1 controls their first hero, player 2 controls their first hero, player 1 controls second hero, etc
A character takes an action. Available actions depend entirely on class, and more classes will be added over time.
Heroes have some amount of health.
There is no concept of location, movement, range, etc.
Last team to have a hero alive wins.

Heroes will have complex abilities with event handling, so will use the 'game_engine' prototype in tne engine file.
This may need to be merged in to BaseEnvironment, or may not. They were developed separately.
